Description:

“this festival rocks”, “world-class”, “too good to be true” - AE’24 punters

Boorloo’s annual “experimental music bender” may now be entered into your calendars: Audible Edge ’25 will take place from April 3 – 6.

AE is a celebration of DIY and exploratory music culture on Whadjuk Noongar boodja. It has no genre affiliation and is home to all kinds of sonic strangeness. It has a boundless affection for the unhinged, the goofy and the peerlessly rigorous alike. It is about special music without frills, in a setting that strives to be fun, friendly, safe, and accessible.

If 2024’s festival was something that shimmered and shined, AE’25 is the same but dropped in the mud. There is a flute under water, a women’s wartime song, a tiny rattling machine, the crackle of burning tree-stumps, a vulture’s wings cutting the air, a binaural recording of high-heels sinking into wet grass. Sometimes listened to from something soft and comfy, and other times in a much sillier setting.

AE is about learning about where we are through those who have courageously dreamed of how this time and place could sound. It’s about learning how sick our scene is by putting it on even-footing with international heavy hitters. And it’s about being on the side of artists, finding ways to support exploratory expression here.

No formula changes in ’25: we haven’t run out of ideas yet. If you came before, you know what you’re in for, and you know it’s time to block out those dates (and maybe a chill day after). If you haven’t been before, we’d love to welcome you into this cool thing.

Stay tuned for the announcement of our program launch party in February 2025.
