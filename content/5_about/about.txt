Description:

“this festival rocks”, “world-class”, “too good to be true” - AE’24 punters

Boorloo’s annual “experimental music bender” may now be entered into your calendars: Audible Edge ’25 will take place from April 3 – 6.

AE is a celebration of DIY and exploratory music culture. It has no genre affiliation and is home to just about every sort of sonic strangeness. It has a boundless affection for the unhinged, the silly and the peerlessly rigorous alike. It is about extraordinary music without frills, in a setting that strives to be fun, friendly, safe, and accessible.

If 2024’s festival was something that shimmered and shined, AE’25 is the same but dropped in the mud. There is a flute under water, a women’s wartime song, a tiny rattling machine, the crackle of burning tree-stumps, a vulture’s wings cutting the air, a binaural recording of high-heels sinking into wet grass, a slinky in the wind. In an unpredictable, compelling sequence. Ebbing and flowing between soft rests into the earth and Dionysian celebrations upon it.

AE is about learning about where we are through those who have most courageously dreamed of how this time and place could sound. It’s about learning how sick our scene is by putting it on even-footing with international heavyhitters. And it’s about paying a lot of artists properly to do what they do.

No formula changes in ’25. We haven’t run out of ideas yet. If you came before, you know what you’re in for, and you know its time to block out those dates (and maybe a couple of rest days after). If you haven’t been before, we’d love to welcome you in. C u there XO

Reviews:

- “Audible Edge is definitely now a must-see event on the Perth music calendar.” (★★★★★, Jonathan Marshall, Limelight Magazine, 2022)

- “Every aspect [of Nika Mo's Audible Edge performance] seemed so meticulously crafted and flawlessly executed” (Tiffany Ha, SeeSaw, 2021)

- Local label Tone List is now the go-to organisation for Perth experimental music...as evident in the mixed bill programs “Every Which Way” and “Come What May”, Audible Edge 2021 was a triumph. (Jonathan Marshall, SeeSaw, 2021)

- “One must conclude then that Audible Edge has retained much of its rough-and-ready community origins, whilst growing in scale and significance.” (★★★★☆, Jonathan Marshall, Limelight Magazine, 2019)
