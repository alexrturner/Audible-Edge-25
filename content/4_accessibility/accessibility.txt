Intro:

Description: <p>Tone List aspires to make our events safer for the needs and cultures of people with disabilities. To this end, we are working with peer artist and consultant Patrick Gunasekera to explore ways that we can improve the accessibility of Audible Edge now and into the future.</p><p>Accessibility details will always be listed on events, including information regarding: wheelchair accessibility, volume and sound density levels, spaciousness/crowdedness of venue, lighting, nature of terrain, ventilation level, whether alcohol is present or not, and the presence of specific accessibility provisions at an event (such as a low-sensory space).</p><p>All audience members enter Audible Edge venues via the same entranceway. No strobes or fast flashing lights will be used at any point throughout the festival. Support workers, companion card holders and other caregivers may always enter events for free.</p><p>Tone List have a small budget to facilitate accessibility requirements for our audience members. We have an existing partnership with Auslan Stage Left who can provide on-stage interpreting for events on request. We are happy to assist with accessible taxi bookings for safe transport to and from events. Other services or providers may be requested and we will do our best to accommodate you.</p><p>We encourage you to get in contact as early as possible to ensure we can coordinate services in time for you.</p>
