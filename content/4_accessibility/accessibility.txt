Title: Accessibility

----

Intro: 

----

Description: <p>Tone List are in a slow process of building concepts of accessibility and cultural safety into the foundations of how we operate. We work with peer artists Patrick Gunasekera and Zali Morgan towards these aims.</p><p>Information on the following things will always be listed on our events: content warnings, wheelchair accessibility, volume and sound density levels, spaciousness/crowdedness of venue, lighting, nature of terrain, ventilation level, whether alcohol is present or not, and the presence of specific accessibility provisions at an event (such as a low-sensory space or party aunty). We may add others based on the results of specific consultations, or unique aspects of the venue or program.</p><p>All audience members enter Audible Edge venues via the same entranceway. No strobes or fast flashing lights will be used at any point throughout the festival. Support workers, companion card holders, caregivers and people experiencing financial hardship may always enter events for free. Our ticket pricings are accessible and opt-in, and do not require proof of entitlement.</p><p>Tone List have a small budget to facilitate accessibility requirements for our audience members such as Auslan interpreting. We will publish details on this upon announcement of public programming in early 2025. Feel free to get in touch with specific requests or questions in advance.</p>
