Title: Accessibility

Intro:

Description: <p>Tone List are in a slow process of building concepts of accessibility and cultural safety into the foundations of how we operate. We work with peer artists Patrick Gunasekera and Zali Morgan towards these aims.</p><p>Some of the things we do include: clear communication about ventilation, sound volume and density, crowdedness, lighting, wheelchair access and terrain for each show. We don’t use strobe lights. We provide free earplugs and masks. We host shows with snacks and healthy food, and alcohol-free shows. We have shows that are kid-friendly, all-ages, and shows at times that are easier for parents to attend. We have party aunties on staff at busy shows. We put up content warnings.</p><p>Closer to the date, we open a portal for requesting specific access provisions at events (such as interpreters, or a wheelchair taxi between gigs). We have a budget for this. Feel free to get in touch with us if you’d like information about this in advance.</p>
