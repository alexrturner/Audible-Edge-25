Bio-long: <p><strong>ART CLUB</strong> is an after school art program run by the City of Melville that connects children with local artists. Each term the group meets weekly to explore creative practice through the lens of the facilitating artist. More than just an art class for kids, ART CLUB is about being part of a creative community, understanding place and identity through art practice, and the exploration of non-traditional mediums. In term 1 2025 the group has worked with musician Saskia Willinge, to form an improvising super group. Responding to the site of Yagan Mia Wireless Hill, they have learned and made up stories of the place, walked through nature reserves, considered the communications history of the site, and devised some exciting ways to make sounds about it. This will be their debut performance, expect the unexpected.</p>
